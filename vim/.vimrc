" Indent the entire file. Thanks for the suggestion, @ssmatiuri.

" Make window navigation less painful.

imap <C-TAB>    <Esc>:bnext<CR>a
imap <C-S-TAB>  <Esc>:bprev<CR>a

" NERDTree: map ,nt for toggling NERDTree. Faster than the old :NT command
" since I don't have to hold Shift whenever I want to display NERDTree.
nmap <Leader>nt :NERDTreeToggle<cr>
:let g:NERDTreeWinSize=20

" To make toggling easier, I just have to map an unused key, such
" as F5. This mapping will work both in Normal and in Insert mode. By
" pressing this key, relative numbers are automatically toggled.
